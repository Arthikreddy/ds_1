# Students Grading Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of students' grades to gain insights into their performance using data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis techniques. The dataset undergoes various stages of cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover meaningful patterns.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of students' academic records, including numerical and categorical variables representing different attributes such as scores, demographics, and other relevant factors. The primary objectives are:
- Understanding grade distributions.
- Identifying correlations between variables.
- Detecting and handling missing values and outliers.
- Performing univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.

## Data Preprocessing
### 1. Handling Missing Values
- Identified missing values and filled them with mean, median, or mode as appropriate.
- Checked for duplicate rows and removed them to maintain data integrity.

### 2. Removing Unnecessary Columns
- Dropped columns that do not contribute significantly to the analysis.

### 3. Handling Outliers
- Used box plots and statistical methods to identify outliers.
- Applied appropriate transformations or removals to handle extreme values.

## Data Analysis
### 1. Univariate Analysis
- Visualized individual variables using histograms, KDE plots, and box plots.
- Analyzed the distribution of numerical variables.
- Summarized categorical variables with bar plots and pie charts.

### 2. Bivariate Analysis
- Explored relationships between two variables using scatter plots, line plots, and bar charts.
- Used correlation coefficients to quantify relationships between numerical variables.
- Created crosstabs and heatmaps to analyze categorical dependencies.

### 3. Multivariate Analysis
- Constructed a correlation matrix to study relationships among multiple variables.
- Visualized correlations using a heatmap to identify highly correlated attributes.
- Applied clustering techniques or PCA (if required) for dimensionality reduction.

## Visualization
The project includes various plots to understand the dataset better:
- Histograms and KDE plots for distribution analysis.
- Box plots to detect outliers.
- Heatmaps for correlation visualization.
- Bar plots and pie charts for categorical insights.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/students-grading-analysis.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to see the analysis and visualizations.

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into students' grading patterns using statistical and visualization techniques. It helps in understanding key factors affecting performance and suggests areas for further investigation.
